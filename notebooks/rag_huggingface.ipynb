For example, sighted people are often more attracted to images than words, \\nwhich leads website designers to rely on images that, in many cases, blind and \\nvisually-impaired users cannot effectively interpret. Alternative text, also commonly \\nreferred to as ALT text, refers to a description of an image that can be written, for \\nexample, using hypertext markup language (HTML) elements. The use of ALT text \\nattempts to render w ebsites more accessible for users. However, in conventional \\nALT text approaches, human users typically must determine and manually enter the \\nALT text for a given image, which often results in errors and delays.  \\n \\n6.

Abstract: The present disclosure relates generally to compositions and methods for \\nimproving T cell therapy. In particular, the disclosure provides polypeptides and \\nrecombinant nucleic acid constructs and/or recombinant nucleic acids encoding \\npolypeptides having mutations capable of altering T cell signaling, cytokine production, \\nand/or in vivo persistence in tumors of therapeutic T cells comprising the mutation. The T \\ncell signaling can be by NFAT, NF -κB and/or AP -1 pathways. The disclosure also provides \\nvectors and cells including the polypeptides and/or recombinant nucleic acid constructs \\nand/or recombinant nucleic acids of the disclosure as well as methods of preparing a T cell \\nfor use in cell therapy, and methods of identifying a mutation useful for imp roving T cell \\ntherapy.  \\n5. BACKGROUND  \\na. Adoptive T cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have \\nrevolutionized cancer therapy. However, impressive responses are limited to a \\nsubset of patients with hematological cancers and have not been unlocked in \\npatients with solid  tumors, which represent 90% of adult cancers. In both \\ntreatment -resistant hematological and solid cancers, adoptive T cell therapy is \\nlimited by a complex combination of factors including fitness of engineered T cells \\nin tumors, T cell exhaustion, poor in  vivo persistence and immunosuppressive \\nenvironmental factors. Despite significant recent advances, rational design has \\nfailed to overcome the problems associated with such factors.  \\nb. Another approach to identify modifications that improve T cell function in vitro and \\nin vivo, besides rational design, is unbiased screening. For example, the vast \\nmajority of screening efforts, have focused on genome -scale or genome -wide \\nalterations which  modify expression of endogenous wild -type genes via CRISPR -\\nCas9 or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or cDNA overexpression.  \\nc. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that include an antigen \\nspecific extracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) attached to a flexible \\nlinker (hinge) region, transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains. \\nThe intracellular portion of the receptor consists of T cell signaling domains such as \\n41BB, CD28 and CD3zeta, designed to mimic T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and \\nthe immunological synapse upon engagement with the antigen specified by the \\nscFv. CAR constructs do not require antigen presentation by MHC molecules, and \\ntherefore have been used to effectively redirect a patient's own T cells against a \\ntumor specific cell surface antigen. To date, five CD19 targeted CAR -T cell therapies \\nhave been approved by the FDA  for use against hematological B cell cancers. While\"),\n",

In \\nthe solid tumor setting, CAR -T cells can become exhausted and struggle to \\nproliferate and perform effector function, ultimately resulting in the inability to \\ncontrol tumor growth or prevent relapse. Therefore, to create effective targeted \\ncellular therapies against solid tumors the proliferative capacity, persistence and \\neffector functio n of CAR-T cells needs to be improved.  \\nd. An avenue under investigation is genetically modifying CAR -T cells to improve their \\nfunctionality in solid tumors. A recent case study described a chronic lymphocytic \\nleukemia (CLL) patient who experienced a delayed yet complete response after \\ntreatment wi th a CD19 CAR -T cell therapy. It was later discovered that, within a \\nsingle T cell clone, the CD19 CAR cassette had integrated into the one allele of TET2, \\na known T cell lymphoma tumor suppressor, rendering it nonfunctional. \\nInterestingly, the second TET2  allele of this patient was also mutated, resulting in a \\nlack of function of TET2 in the CD19 CAR -T cells dosed to this patient. This single \\nTET2 knockout CAR -T cell clone exhibited altered T cell differentiation and improved \\noverall effector function. Ult imately, this clone expanded to become a majority of \\nthe CAR-T cell population, and mediated a complete response against the patient's \\nrelapsed CLL. In a second example, a similar complete response was mediated in a \\npatient when the CD22 CAR cassette integ rated into the T cell lymphoma tumor \\nsuppressor CBL. These case studies demonstrate that genetic knockout of T cell \\nlymphoma tumor suppressors, such as TET2 and CBL, can have remarkable \\nbeneficial effects on CAR -T cell therapies. In preclinical studies, ge nome wide \\nknockout assays have revealed genes, such as REGNASE, that upon knockout \\nimprove T cell fitness and anti -tumor efficacy in vivo. Additionally, other studies \\nhave found that the knockout of genes related to T cell exhaustion and memory \\nformation, such as the NR4A family of genes, can result in improved and prolonged \\nCAR-T cell response to tumors.  \\ne. While these examples indicate that CAR -T cell functionality can be improved \\nthrough genetic manipulation, particularly through manipulation of tumor \\nsuppressor genes, these studies are often extremely broad in their scope (examining \\nthe entire genome) and focus solely on the effect of constitutive genetic knockouts. \\nSomatic single nucleotide variant (SSNV) mutations, translocations and gene \\ndeletions that naturally arise in cancers offer biologically rational candidates for \\ngenetic manipulation alongside CA R expression.  \\nf. There remains a need in the art for alternative solutions to address the significant \\nunmet need for effective adoptive T cell therapies and for enhancing engineered T \\ncell fitness.\"),\n",

The electronic device \\nincludes a touch screen and a fingerprint sensor. The electronic device displays a first \\ninterface and captures first fingerprint information that is input by a user at the fi rst \\ninterface. The electronic device determines whether the touch screen is in a first state, and \\nthe first state is used to indicate that the touch screen is in a screen protector state. If the \\ntouch screen is in the first state, the electronic device res tores the first fingerprint \\ninformation by using a first preset artificial intelligence (AI) restoration model to obtain \\nsecond fingerprint information. The electronic device determines that the second \\nfingerprint information matches preset fingerprint inf ormation and displays a second \\ninterface. Quality of a fingerprint image in the second fingerprint information is higher than \\nquality of a fingerprint image in the first fingerprint information.  \\n6. BACKGROUND  \\na. As a new technical breakthrough caused by the evolution of touch screens, in -\\nscreen fingerprints are gradually applied to electronic devices (for example, mobile \\nphones). With regard to the in -screen fingerprint, a fingerprint sensor is integrated \\nunder a touch screen of an electronic device, and the fingerprint sensor may \\ncapture fingerprint information of a user in response to a touch operation of the user \\nin a preset position on the touch screen. The fingerprint information may be used for \\nfingerprint re cognition in a scenario such as payment or unlock.  \\nb.  A success rate of in -screen fingerprint recognition depends to a large extent on \\nquality of a fingerprint image in the fingerprint information captured by the \\nfingerprint sensor. Higher quality of the fingerprint image in the fingerprint \\ninformation captu red by the fingerprint sensor indicates a higher success rate of \\nuser identity verification by using the fingerprint information (that is, in -screen \\nfingerprint recognition). The quality of the fingerprint image in the fingerprint \\ninformation captured by t he fingerprint sensor may be affected by a degree of fitting \\na user finger to the touch screen, a degree of accuracy of touching a position by a \\nuser, and the like.  \\nc.  There are, certainly, other factors that may affect the quality of the fingerprint image \\nin the fingerprint information captured by the fingerprint sensor. For example, to \\nprotect a touch screen, a user often applies a film, such as a tempered film or a \\nhydrogel film, to an electronic device (for example, a mobile phone). Applying a film \\nto the electronic device undoubtedly increases a distance between the fingerprint \\nsensor disposed under the touch screen and a user finger, thereby affecting the \\nquality of the fingerprint image in the fingerprint information captured by the'),\n",

Abstract: This disclosure provides a method for the standardized production, financing and \\ndelivery of housing using distributed ledger technology and a decentralized artificially \\nintelligent cyber -physical system (CPS or invention) for compiling data and executing \\nhuman and deep learning sequences for the purposes of standardizing the planning and \\nexecution of real estate development, regulatory compliance, financing, supply chain \\nprocurement, industrial manufacturing processes, logistical processes as well as proje ct \\nmanagement tasks, and other various construction, manufacturing and delivery tasks and \\nprocedures to standardize development, production, and delivery of standardizes building \\nmodules and standardized building components in a standardized smart factory that are \\nused to assemble structures.  \\n6. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION  \\n(3) The housing market has failed to produce affordable housing at the scale and speed \\ndemanded by consumers, as evidenced by homelessness, sub -standard housing with poor \\naccess to basic services, and key segments of society being unable to afford to live near to \\ntheir place of work. In other words, the housing market does not deliver housing efficiently \\nand equitably.  \\n(4) The reasons for the failures are multi -faceted: the construction industry is extensively \\nregulated, subject to e verything from permits and approvals to safety and work -site \\ncontrols, and lowest -price rules in tenders make competition based on quality, reliability, or \\nalternative design offerings more complicated; bespoke projects with unique features and \\nvarying top ology have a limited degree of repeatability and standardization; each project \\ninvolves many steps and companies with scattered accountability, which complicates the \\ncoordination, substantially increasing costs; contractual structures and incentives are \\nmisaligned; risks are often passed to other areas of the value chain instead of being \\naddressed, and participants make money from claims rather than from good delivery.  \\n(5) Further, the regulatory agencies have misaligned and inconsistent requirements for the \\naffordable housing programs they administer resulting in a cumbersome approval process \\nfor developers who need state resources to support their projects. Because the se \\ndevelopers must often use multiple sources of funding for their developments to be \\nfinancially feasible, the misaligned requirements slow development and increase project \\ncosts. Projects often get stalled at the local level and there is no oversight from the state to \\nensure projects are facilitated and completed rather than stalled by local  regulations having \\nto do with density, design, building materials, setbacks, parking, lot size and location.  \\n(6) Governments play a critical role in supporting affordable housing development and \\nprivate investment alone cannot achieve the needed amount of  housing construction at \\ncosts that are affordable. Governments lack an effective approach to planning and'),\n",

Governments are unable to \\nformulate a clear plan describing how or where its billions of dollars for housing will have \\nthe most impact nor can they effectively prepare or respond to natural or man -made \\ndisasters. And there is nothing in place, which facilitates a population level response in \\ncase of a natural or man -made disaster and governments have no way to prepare for an \\nemergency, much less respond to one, be it Covid, a hurricane or the inabili ty to house its \\npopulation resulting in an ever -growing number of unhoused individuals and families.  \\n(7) There is no predictability and no transparency and there is no way to improve on the \\ncurrent system, which would make a large enough impact to spur the construction at the \\nscale required to meet the population -level need. Governments cannot formulate h ousing \\nplans explaining how state financial resources will contribute to meeting current and future \\nhousing need and identifying where those resources will  have the most impact —highest \\nand best use. Governments are also unable to identify sites suitable to accommodate the \\nbuilding modules needed and cannot take proper action to mitigate any barriers to \\ndevelopment at the local level.  \\n(8) Everyone agrees that there is a problem, but no one knows how to solve it and therefore \\ncities cannot generate any actionable plans. Worse yet, governments can only look to the \\npast as a guide for the future and therefore can only project or define pla ns based on old \\ndata and  outdated methods because planning based on untrustworthy, non -transparent, \\nunknown, new methods or data is simply too unreliable.  \\n(9) A supply -side solution to the housing crisis is not achievable without the alignment of all \\nstakeholders along the value chain (including public and private parties) and the \\nstandardization of the relevant processes, methods and products. Housing comes  down to \\nmany individual and local choices and consequently there is a great need for a system to \\nalign the various needs aro und the core objective of meeting the housing need at scale in \\norder to respond to the housing crisis as well as natural and man -made disasters.  \\n(10) Until now, there has never been a way to converge either the stakeholders or the \\ntechnology in order to facilitate the standardized production, financing and delivery of \\nhousing. Governments and private parties had no way to interact at scale. Converg ence of \\nthe technology facilitates the convergence and alignment of the stakeholders in one system \\nwhere predic tability, reliability and transparency are paramount and facilitate the \\nstandardized production, financing, manufacturing and delivery of housing at population \\nlevels to meet the needs of the community.  \\n(11) Additionally, the inability of governments to efficiently deploy funding and release land \\nto support the creation of affordable housing has made projects reliant on private donors to \\nfund projects as charitable donations, which keeps both governments and developers from \\nhaving a steady, reliable and tra nsparent way to finance housing projects.  \\n(12) Thus, a continuing need exists for cyber -physical system that incorporates the various \\nneeds of stakeholders into an efficient system that enables the standardized production of \\nhousing in a streamlined and efficient manner.  \\n7.

Abstract: Networked device management is based on an ontology graph which includes \\ndevice nodes, physical facility nodes, and edges. The ontology graph may go beyond \\nnetwork topology by also documenting: relationships between devices and facilities, facility \\nattributes such as facility -specific security scores, and device characteristics such as \\nwhether a device is recognized, whether it is authorized, and its mission criticality. Medical \\ndevices, physical condition sensors, and other internet of things devices, incl uding those \\nembedded in vehicles, those located on a vehicle, those used for industrial control, or those \\nwhich are intermittently air -gapped, are managed. Devices may be discovered by extraction \\nof identifications and characteristics from telemetry data i n a staged architecture. Security \\npostures may be assessed, and security recommendations based on device context may be \\nprovided.  \\n6. BACKGROUND  \\na. (1) A wide variety of devices may be connected by a network. Some devices include \\ncomputing hardware, which may be controlled by firmware or other software. Some \\ndevices include physical condition sensors, to sense temperature, humidity, \\nacceleration, pres sure, position, or other physical conditions. Some devices include \\na display screen, while others do not. Some devices can only transmit data over a \\nnetwork connection, while other devices can transmit data and also receive data. \\nSome devices have a typica l working life span of multiple years, while others cease \\nto be reliable, or even to function at all, after a shorter time. Some devices are \\ninexpensive, while others are not.  \\nb. (2) Efforts to manage networked devices also vary widely. Management may be \\ndirected at goals such as accuracy, convenience, coverage, economy, efficiency, \\nflexibility, portability, reliability, or security, for example. Improvements in networked \\ndevice ma nagement are possible with respect to various goals.  \\n7. SUMMARY  \\na. (3) Some embodiments described herein address technical challenges related to \\nnetworked device management, such as how to formulate device -specific \\nmanagement recommendations, as opposed to more general recommendations \\nthat do not apply as well to the spec ific device and its circumstances. Some \\nembodiments manage networked devices based on relationships between specific \\ndevices and specific physical facilities, e.g., based on facility -specific security \\nscores.  \\nb.
