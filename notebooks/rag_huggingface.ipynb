The disclosure also provides \\nvectors and  cells including the polypeptides and/or recombinant nucleic acid constructs \\nand/or recombinant nucleic acids of the disclosure as well as methods of preparing a T cell \\nfor use in cell therapy, and methods of identifying a mutation useful for improving T c ell \\ntherapy.  \\n5. BACKGROUND  \\na. Adoptive T cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have \\nrevolutionized cancer therapy. However, impressive responses are limited to a \\nsubset of patients with hematological cancers and have not been unlocked in \\npatients with solid  tumors, which represent 90% of adult cancers. In both \\ntreatment -resistant hematological and solid cancers, adoptive T cell therapy is \\nlimited by a complex combination of factors including fitness of engineered T cells \\nin tumors, T cell exhaustion, poor in  vivo persistence and immunosuppressive \\nenvironmental factors. Despite significant recent advances, rational design has \\nfailed to overcome the problems associated with such factors.  \\nb. Another approach to identify modifications that improve T cell function in vitro and \\nin vivo, besides rational design, is unbiased screening. For example, the vast \\nmajority of screening efforts, have focused on genome -scale or genome -wide \\nalterations which  modify expression of endogenous wild -type genes via CRISPR -\\nCas9 or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or cDNA overexpression.  \\nc. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that include an antigen \\nspecific extracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) attached to a flexible \\nlinker (hinge) region, transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains. \\nThe intracellular portion of the receptor consists of T cell signaling domains such as \\n41BB, CD28 and CD3zeta, designed to mimic T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and \\nthe immunological synapse upon engagement with the antigen specified by the \\nscFv. CAR constructs do not require antigen presentation by MHC molecules, and \\ntherefore have been used to effectively redirect a patient's own T cells against a \\ntumor specific cell surface antigen. To date, five CD19 targeted CAR -T cell therapies \\nhave been approved by the FDA  for use against hematological B cell cancers. While\"),\n",

In \\nthe solid tumor setting, CAR -T cells can become exhausted and struggle to \\nproliferate and perform effector function, ultimately resulting in the inability to \\ncontrol tumor growth or prevent relapse. Therefore, to create effective targeted \\ncellular therapies against solid tumors the proliferative capacity, persistence and \\neffector functio n of CAR-T cells needs to be improved.  \\nd. An avenue under investigation is genetically modifying CAR -T cells to improve their \\nfunctionality in solid tumors. A recent case study described a chronic lymphocytic \\nleukemia (CLL) patient who experienced a delayed yet complete response after \\ntreatment wi th a CD19 CAR -T cell therapy. It was later discovered that, within a \\nsingle T cell clone, the CD19 CAR cassette had integrated into the one allele of TET2, \\na known T cell lymphoma tumor suppressor, rendering it nonfunctional. \\nInterestingly, the second TET2  allele of this patient was also mutated, resulting in a \\nlack of function of TET2 in the CD19 CAR -T cells dosed to this patient. This single \\nTET2 knockout CAR -T cell clone exhibited altered T cell differentiation and improved \\noverall effector function. Ult imately, this clone expanded to become a majority of \\nthe CAR-T cell population, and mediated a complete response against the patient's \\nrelapsed CLL. In a second example, a similar complete response was mediated in a \\npatient when the CD22 CAR cassette integ rated into the T cell lymphoma tumor \\nsuppressor CBL. These case studies demonstrate that genetic knockout of T cell \\nlymphoma tumor suppressors, such as TET2 and CBL, can have remarkable \\nbeneficial effects on CAR -T cell therapies. In preclinical studies, ge nome wide \\nknockout assays have revealed genes, such as REGNASE, that upon knockout \\nimprove T cell fitness and anti -tumor efficacy in vivo. Additionally, other studies \\nhave found that the knockout of genes related to T cell exhaustion and memory \\nformation, such as the NR4A family of genes, can result in improved and prolonged \\nCAR-T cell response to tumors.  \\ne. While these examples indicate that CAR -T cell functionality can be improved \\nthrough genetic manipulation, particularly through manipulation of tumor \\nsuppressor genes, these studies are often extremely broad in their scope (examining \\nthe entire genome) and focus solely on the effect of constitutive genetic knockouts. \\nSomatic single nucleotide variant (SSNV) mutations, translocations and gene \\ndeletions that naturally arise in cancers offer biologically rational candidates for \\ngenetic manipulation alongside CA R expression.  \\nf. There remains a need in the art for alternative solutions to address the significant \\nunmet need for effective adoptive T cell therapies and for enhancing engineered T \\ncell fitness.\")]"

BACKGROUND  \\na. Adoptive T cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have \\nrevolutionized cancer therapy. However, impressive responses are limited to a \\nsubset of patients with hematological cancers and have not been unlocked in \\npatients with solid  tumors, which represent 90% of adult cancers. In both \\ntreatment -resistant hematological and solid cancers, adoptive T cell therapy is \\nlimited by a complex combination of factors including fitness of engineered T cells'),\n",
